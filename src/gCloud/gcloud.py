# Depending on which database you are using, you'll set some variables differently. 
# In this code we are inserting only one field with one value. 
# Feel free to change the insert statement as needed for your own table's requirements.

# Uncomment and set the following variables depending on your specific instance and database:
connection_name = "alice-blue-319710:asia-south1:alice-blue"
table_name = "books"
table_field = "title"
table_field_value = "This is new"
db_name = "ALICE_BLUE"
db_user = "root"
db_password = "googstz3rwa23_"

# If your database is MySQL, uncomment the following two lines:
driver_name = 'mysql+pymysql'
query_string = dict({"unix_socket": "/cloudsql/{}".format(connection_name)})

# If your database is PostgreSQL, uncomment the following two lines:
#driver_name = 'postgres+pg8000'
#query_string =  dict({"unix_sock": "/cloudsql/{}/.s.PGSQL.5432".format(connection_name)})

# If the type of your table_field value is a string, surround it with double quotes.
